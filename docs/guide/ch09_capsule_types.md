# Chapter 9: Capsule Types

The `CtyCapsule` type is a special type in `pyvider.cty` that allows you to encapsulate and protect foreign data types within the `cty` system. This is useful when you need to work with data that cannot be represented by the standard `cty` types, such as file handles, database connections, or other external resources.

## The `CtyCapsule` Type

To create a `CtyCapsule` type, you must provide a name for the type:

```python
from pyvider.cty import CtyCapsule

file_handle_type = CtyCapsule("FileHandle")
```

This creates a new `CtyCapsule` type that can be used to encapsulate file handle objects.

## Encapsulating and Accessing Data

You can encapsulate a foreign data type in a `CtyCapsule` value using the `validate` method:

```python
# Create a dummy file handle object
class FileHandle:
    def __init__(self, path):
        self.path = path

file_handle = FileHandle("/path/to/file")

# Encapsulate the file handle in a CtyCapsule value
cty_file_handle = file_handle_type.validate(file_handle)
```

You can then access the encapsulated object using the `raw_value` property:

```python
encapsulated_handle = cty_file_handle.raw_value
assert encapsulated_handle.path == "/path/to/file"
```

## Type Safety

`CtyCapsule` types are type-safe. This means that you can only encapsulate objects of the correct type in a `CtyCapsule` value.

```python
# This will raise a ValidationError
try:
    file_handle_type.validate("not a file handle")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Validation failed: {e}")
```

This type safety ensures that you can't accidentally mix up different types of encapsulated data.
