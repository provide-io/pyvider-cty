# Welcome to Pyvider CTY

**A powerful and flexible type system for Python, compatible with HashiCorp's go-cty.**

`pyvider.cty` is a pure-Python implementation of the [go-cty](https://github.com/zclconf/go-cty) type system, providing strong type validation and serialization capabilities for configuration data. It's designed to work seamlessly with Terraform providers and other HashiCorp ecosystem tools.

## Why Pyvider CTY?

### ‚ö° **Expressive and Flexible**
- **Rich Type System**: A comprehensive set of primitive, collection, and structural types to model your data accurately.
- **Dynamic Types**: Handle data with unknown or varying structures using the dynamic type.
- **Capsule Types**: Encapsulate and protect foreign data types within the `cty` system.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Experience**
- **Modern Python**: Leverages Python 3.11+ features with complete type annotations.
- **Clear and Concise API**: A simple and intuitive API for defining types, validating data, and working with values.
- **Detailed Diagnostics**: Get detailed error messages and validation diagnostics to quickly identify and fix issues.

### üèóÔ∏è **Robust and Reliable**
- **Immutable Values**: `cty` values are immutable, ensuring data integrity and preventing unintended side effects.
- **Thoroughly Tested**: A comprehensive test suite ensures the library is reliable and production-ready.
- **Battle-Tested Concepts**: Based on the well-established `cty` type system from HashiCorp's Terraform.

### üîÑ **Cross-Language Compatibility**
- **Go-Cty Interoperability**: Serialize and deserialize data in MessagePack format compatible with go-cty.
- **Terraform Integration**: Parse Terraform type strings and work with Terraform data structures.

## Quick Example

```python
from pyvider.cty import CtyObject, CtyString, CtyNumber, CtyList

# Define a type schema
user_type = CtyObject(
    attribute_types={
        "name": CtyString(),
        "age": CtyNumber(),
        "hobbies": CtyList(element_type=CtyString())
    },
    optional_attributes={"age"}
)

# Validate data
user_data = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking"]
}

user_val = user_type.validate(user_data)
print(f"Name: {user_val['name'].raw_value}")
```
