# Chapter 17: Glossary

This glossary defines key terms and concepts used throughout the `pyvider.cty` documentation.

*   **Type**: A `pyvider.cty` type defines the shape and constraints of your data.
*   **Value**: A `pyvider.cty` value is an instance of a `cty` type. It holds the actual data and is immutable.
*   **Validation**: The process of checking if a raw Python value conforms to a given `cty` type.
*   **Conversion**: The process of converting between `cty` values and raw Python values.
*   **Function**: A `pyvider.cty` function is a built-in operation for manipulating `cty` values.
*   **Mark**: A piece of metadata that is attached to a `cty` value.
*   **Null**: A special value that represents the absence of a value.
*   **Unknown**: A special value that represents a value that is not yet known.
*   **Capsule**: A special type that allows you to encapsulate and protect foreign data types within the `cty` system.
*   **Primitive Type**: A basic building block of the type system, such as `CtyString`, `CtyNumber`, or `CtyBool`.
*   **Collection Type**: A type that represents a collection of other types, such as `CtyList`, `CtySet`, or `CtyMap`.
*   **Structural Type**: A type that represents more complex, structured data, such as `CtyObject` or `CtyTuple`.
*   **Dynamic Type**: A special type that can represent any type of value.
