# Release Notes

This document provides current status and release readiness information for the `pyvider.cty` library.

## Documentation

✅ **Documentation Status: Excellent**

The documentation has been completely restructured to align with provide.io ecosystem patterns:
- New getting started guides with 5-minute quick start
- Comprehensive user guide organized by topic
- Complete API reference with mkdocstrings integration
- Material for MkDocs theme with modern navigation
- All examples updated and organized by category

## Code Quality

✅ **Code Quality: Excellent**

- **Type Checking**: All mypy checks pass with strict mode enabled
- **Code Style**: Follows ruff formatting and linting standards
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite covering core functionality
- **Security**: Bandit security analysis passes

## Feature Parity with `go-cty`

The following is a feature comparison matrix between `go-cty` and `pyvider.cty`.

| Feature | `go-cty` | `pyvider.cty` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Language** | Go | Python | The most obvious difference is the language. `go-cty` is written in Go, while `pyvider.cty` is written in Python. |
| **API** | The `go-cty` API is designed to be idiomatic Go. | The `pyvider.cty` API is designed to be idiomatic Python. | This means that the two APIs are not directly compatible, but the underlying concepts are the same. |
| **Extensibility** | `go-cty` can be extended with custom types and functions. | `pyvider.cty` can also be extended with custom types and functions. | The mechanism for extension is different in the two libraries. |
| **Performance** | `go-cty` is a compiled language, so it is generally faster than `pyvider.cty`. | `pyvider.cty` is an interpreted language, so it is generally slower than `go-cty`. | However, `pyvider.cty` is still fast enough for most use cases. |
| **Primitive Types** | Yes | Yes | |
| **Collection Types** | Yes | Yes | |
| **Structural Types** | Yes | Yes | |
| **Dynamic Types** | Yes | Yes | |
| **Capsule Types** | Yes | Yes | |
| **Marks** | Yes | Yes | |
| **Functions** | Yes | Yes | `pyvider.cty` has a comprehensive set of built-in functions that is comparable to `go-cty`. |
| **Serialization** | Yes | Yes | `pyvider.cty` supports Msgpack serialization, which is compatible with `go-cty`. |
| **Path Navigation** | Yes | Yes | |
| **Terraform Interoperability** | Yes | Yes | `pyvider.cty` can parse Terraform type strings. |
