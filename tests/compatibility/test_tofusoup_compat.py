"""Cross-language compatibility tests using TofuSoup.

The Go compatibility infrastructure has been replaced by TofuSoup, which provides
comprehensive cross-language conformance testing for CTY implementations.

To run cross-language compatibility tests:

1. Install TofuSoup from the tofusoup repository
2. Run: `soup cty test`
3. Run: `soup cty benchmark` for performance validation

TofuSoup provides:
- Go harnesses for CTY serialization/deserialization
- Bidirectional testing (Go â†” Python)
- Rich CLI tools for debugging and validation
- Performance benchmarking

For more information, see the TofuSoup repository and documentation."""
